maybe instead of moving the chucks 

just mark all of them from 0 to 25*32 pos for each chunks.

Then just have a location x that tracks how much the "playerpos" moves. 

#But have it only update when the player is at the coners of the screen.

locationx = 0
locationx += 1
locationx -= 1

#tell the draw function to draw the chunks in the locationx.

Have the chunkpos be the incation on what chunks or chunk to load.
